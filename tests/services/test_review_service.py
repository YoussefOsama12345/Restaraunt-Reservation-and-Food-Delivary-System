Unit tests for the Review Service.

This module verifies the correct behavior of the ReviewService, focusing on:

- Creating reviews for menu items or restaurants
- Preventing duplicate reviews from the same user
- Retrieving reviews by item, restaurant, or user
- Updating and deleting reviews
- Calculating average ratings

Mocks are used to simulate database operations and isolate the service logic.
