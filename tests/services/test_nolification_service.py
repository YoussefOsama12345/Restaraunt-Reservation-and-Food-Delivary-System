test_notification_service.py

Unit tests for the Notification Service.

This test module ensures the correctness of the core functionalities provided by the
NotificationService class, including:

- Creating notifications for users
- Retrieving user-specific notifications
- Marking notifications as read (individually and in bulk)
- Deleting single and all notifications for a user

Mock objects are used to isolate the database layer and test service logic independently.
