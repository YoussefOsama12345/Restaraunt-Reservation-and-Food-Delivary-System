Unit tests for the Order Service.

This module tests the functionality of the OrderService class, ensuring reliable
behavior for order management including:

- Creating new orders
- Updating order status
- Fetching orders by ID and user
- Listing all orders
- Deleting orders
- Calculating totals and handling edge cases

Mocks are used to isolate the database dependency.
