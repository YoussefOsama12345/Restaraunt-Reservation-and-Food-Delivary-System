test_reservation_service.py

Unit tests for the Reservation Service.

This module ensures that the ReservationService behaves as expected when:

- Creating table reservations
- Preventing double-booking for the same time slot
- Retrieving reservations by user or ID
- Updating reservation details
- Cancelling reservations
- Handling edge cases like invalid time or overlapping bookings

All database operations are mocked to isolate and test service logic.
