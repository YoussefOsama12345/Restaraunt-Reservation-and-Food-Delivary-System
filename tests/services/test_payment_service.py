test_payment_service.py

Unit tests for the Payment Service.

This module verifies the correctness of the PaymentService, covering:

- Initiating and processing payments
- Handling payment status updates
- Managing refunds and edge cases
- Verifying payment records
- Interacting with third-party payment gateways (mocked)

Mock objects are used to simulate database operations and external payment integrations.
