"""
Unit tests for the User Service.

This module verifies the functionality of the UserService class, including:

- Registering new users
- Authenticating users
- Retrieving user profiles
- Updating user information
- Deleting user accounts
- Handling edge cases like duplicate emails or invalid credentials

All database operations are mocked to isolate and test the service logic effectively.
