test_support_service.py

Unit tests for the Support Service.

This module validates the behavior of the SupportService, including:

- Creating support tickets from users
- Listing all support tickets or filtering by user
- Updating support ticket status (e.g., resolved, pending)
- Adding admin responses to tickets
- Deleting support tickets

All interactions with the database are mocked to ensure isolated service testing.
