"""
Unit tests for the Category SQLAlchemy model.

This test module verifies:
- The existence and types of fields within the Category model
- Correct default values (e.g., timestamps)
- Relationship integrity between Category and MenuItem models
- That instances of Category can be created and accessed correctly

Assumes:
- SQLAlchemy models are correctly defined with `id`, `name`, and `created_at` fields
- MenuItem model has a valid ForeignKey pointing to Category

Does not interact with a real database (mock or in-memory session recommended for full testing).
