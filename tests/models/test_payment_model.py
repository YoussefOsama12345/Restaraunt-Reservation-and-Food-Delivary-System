"""
Unit tests for the Payment SQLAlchemy model.

This test module verifies:
- Field definitions and expected data types
- Default values for status and timestamps
- Relationship integrity between Payment and related Order
- Correct storage of transaction metadata (e.g., payment method, amount)
- Timestamp behavior for created_at and updated_at fields

Assumes:
- The Payment model includes fields like: id, order_id, amount, status, payment_method,
  transaction_id, created_at, updated_at
- There is a relationship between Payment and the Order model
