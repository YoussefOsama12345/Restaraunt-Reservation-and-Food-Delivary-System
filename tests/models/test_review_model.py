"""
Unit tests for the Review SQLAlchemy model.

This module verifies:
- Presence and correctness of model fields such as user_id, rating, comment, etc.
- Default values (e.g., created_at, updated_at timestamps)
- Valid relationships to User, MenuItem, or Restaurant (depending on model design)
- Validation of rating values (if applicable)
- That instances of Review can be created and accessed properly

Assumptions:
- Review model includes fields: id, user_id, menu_item_id or restaurant_id, rating, comment, created_at, updated_at
- Rating is expected to be a value from 1 to 5
- Relationships are established via SQLAlchemy foreign keys
