"""
Unit tests for the DeliveryTask SQLAlchemy model.

This test module verifies:
- Field existence and data types in the DeliveryTask model
- Default values and enum/status behavior
- Relationships between DeliveryTask, User (driver), and Order
- Timestamp creation and updates

Assumes:
- DeliveryTask model includes fields like id, order_id, driver_id, status, otp, created_at, updated_at
- The status field may include values like 'assigned', 'en_route', 'delivered', 'failed'
- Relationships are correctly configured for foreign keys to users and orders
