Unit tests for the User SQLAlchemy model.

This module checks:
- Existence and correctness of fields (email, hashed_password, is_active, etc.)
- Default values for boolean and timestamp fields
- Relationship mappings (e.g., to Address, Orders)
- Behavior of the modelâ€™s utility or computed fields if any
