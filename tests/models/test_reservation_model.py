"""
Unit tests for the Reservation SQLAlchemy model.

This test module ensures:
- All expected fields are defined with correct types
- Default values such as status and confirmed are properly set
- Relationship integrity with the User model
- Proper handling of datetime fields for reservation_date, reservation_time,
  created_at, and updated_at

Assumptions:
- The Reservation model includes fields: id, user_id, reservation_date,
  reservation_time, guest_count, special_requests, status, confirmed,
  created_at, updated_at
- ForeignKey relationship to the User model is established
