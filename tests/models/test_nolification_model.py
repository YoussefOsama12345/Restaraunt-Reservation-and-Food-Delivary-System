"""
Unit tests for the Notification SQLAlchemy model.

This test suite ensures:
- All expected fields exist and have the correct types
- Default values like read=False and timestamps are set correctly
- Relationships between Notification and User models (if applicable)
- That instances of Notification can be created and stored properly

Assumptions:
- Notification model includes fields such as id, user_id, message, subject, read, created_at, updated_at
- User relationship is configured using SQLAlchemy foreign key (user_id â†’ users.id)
