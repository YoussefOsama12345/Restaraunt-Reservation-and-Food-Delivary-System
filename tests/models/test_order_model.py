"""
Unit tests for the Order SQLAlchemy model.

Verifies:
- Field existence and correct types
- Default values for status
- Relationships with User and OrderItems
- Behavior of timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- String representation for debugging

Assumes:
- Order model includes fields like id, user_id, total_amount, status, created_at, updated_at
- Relationships are established with User and OrderItem
