"""
Test suite for Cart API routes.

Covers:
- Adding an item to the user's cart
- Retrieving all items in the cart
- Updating the quantity of a cart item
- Removing a specific item from the cart
- Clearing the entire cart

All tests assume that the user is authenticated and that required dependencies (e.g., menu items) exist or are mocked.
