"""
Test suite for Address API routes.

This module tests the `/addresses` endpoints for authenticated users. It covers:
- Creating a new address
- Retrieving all user addresses
- Updating an address by ID
- Deleting an address by ID
- Fetching the default address

All tests require user authentication and assume a working address schema and user model.
